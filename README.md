# LC-3 Virtual Machine

### Run the VM

To run an application on this virtual machine, you need to clone my repo:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Sindvero/SuperVM.git
```

After cloning the repo, you need to build the vm:

```shell
cd SuperVM/src/
make
```

You should see an executable main.

Then, you just need to find a object file to run it (*e.g.* 2048.obj)
